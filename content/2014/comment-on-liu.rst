Liu *et al* recently published a paper called `"GIS-Based Regionalization of LCA" <http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=44940#.U28TJOYbDes>`_ in the "Journal of Geoscience and Environment Protection", published by "Scientific Research" (whose motto apparently is "an academic publisher").

This paper is not life cycle assessment, but `risk assessment <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment#In_public_health>`_.

If you are interested in the methodology of regionalized risk assessment, I recommend my paper `GIS-Based Regionalized Life Cycle Assessment <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es203117z>`_ in Environmental Science & Technology.

I also want to make clear that, in my opinion, the problem with Liu *et al* is not open access but poor peer review. There is no doubt that open access is both necessary and right.
