:summary: A summary of my regionalization talk at the 2012 LCA discussion forum on water

The last `LCA discussion forum of 2012 <http://www.lcaforum.ch/Forum/tabid/57/Default.aspx>`_ is Tuesday, December 3rd. Slides from my talk on regionalization without good regionalized LCA software `are available here <images/DF-2012-Mutel-slides.pdf>`_.

I will be organizing one of the LCA discussion fora in 2013 on practical approaches to uncertainty. Contact me (cmutel@gmail.com) if you are interested in presenting.
