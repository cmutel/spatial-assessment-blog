:summary: A curious tip for Simapro users

In `Brightway2 <http://brightwaylca.org>`_, collections of inventory data are called *databases*. Some such collections have lots of datasets, such as `ecoinvent <http://ecoinvent.org/>`_ or the `US LCI database <http://www.nrel.gov/lci/>`_, and some, like those made for a specific LCA, have only a few datasets.

`SimaPro <http://www.pre-sustainability.com/simapro-lca-software>`_ distinguishes between *libraries*, which come pre-installed, and *projects*, which you make yourself. Here is an interesting tip for Simapro users who want to know what libraries are referenced by their current project: `delete your project <http://web.earthshift.com/blog/bid/278712/New-Time-Saving-Tips-for-SimaPro-LCA-Software-Users>`_.
