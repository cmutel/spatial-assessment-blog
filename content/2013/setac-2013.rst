The `SETAC <http://www.setac.org/>`_ 2013 conference was held from `May 12-16 in Glasgow <http://glasgow.setac.eu/>`_.

Here are my `annotated slides <images/SETAC-2013-Mutel-slides.pdf>`_ from my talk analysing the spatial scales of the different regionalized impact assessment methods developed in the `LC-IMPACT project <http://www.lc-impact.eu/>`_. I used machine learning, and in particular `Ward hierarchal clustering <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward's_method>`_, to improve the methodology of my `previous work <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es203117z>`_.
