The `LCA XIII <http://www.lcacenter.org/LCAXIII.aspx>`_ conference took place in Orlando, Florida, from September 30th to October 3rd, 2013. Although ETH ZÃ¼rich sent only Stephan Pfister and myself; however, we were quite active, with (at least) five presentations, four posters, and a half-day educational class.

Below, I include my posters and presentations.
